To build with the default remote client, just run

	go build

To build with the dhop client, so you can run agains DHop, run

	go build -tags dhop

If you want to add another client xyz, create a file xyzclnt.go and
implement the Connect function for it there. Make it depend on tag xyz
and add !xyz to the +build restrictions in hopclnt.go.
